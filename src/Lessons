1. First look for all the case that would fail. ex.
    if question requires to compare string, check if same length is required or not,
    if not, first right failure case of different length.
2. First write brute force solution.
    then write time optimized solution.
    then write space optimized solution.
3. if iteration over length is required for 2 or more items, try to iterate over all in single loop.
    ex: for (i 0--> n){
        s[0-->n]
        t[0-->n]
    }
4. Dont always focus on the start of the array or string. Sometimes focus on starting from the end as well (mergeSortedArray)
